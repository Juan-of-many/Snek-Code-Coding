                <p>What keeps me going? (potentially in list format)
                    I like working with my hands.
                    I enjoy the creative process within this hobby.
                    I love the many available options paper-folding provides.
                    There are many learning opportunities.
                    Generally, anyone can pick up a piece of paper and make something.
                    It is a niche hobby.
                    Origami can take as much or as little time as you want it to.
                    It is something that makes people smile.
                    Origami gives my hands something to do while my mind can focus on other tasks.</p></p>

                <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
                <p>To all the lovely people who have supported me over the years:
                    
                    We dare to share, a love so real, your comfort, I feel.
                    Your care so fair, I hold you dear, your thoughts, I hear.
                    So wonderful, so true, your words, I view.
                    Your encouragement ever warms my heart.
                    May you find wonder and success every day.
                    
                    An additional hidden message that I share with many pieces of origami that I make is that I took something that would otherwise have been discarded and turned it into a beautiful piece of art for someone else to enjoy. 
                    I turn one man's trash into another man's treasure. 
                    If it is discarded again, that is okay. Even if it gave comfort and joy for only a small moment, it was worth the time it took to fold.
                    In the end, it feels really great to spend time and end up with something tangible to show for my efforts.
                    I hope you've enjoyed following along and will check back in later as I add new guides and update old ones.</p>
