<!-- I overhauled my color palette by going into photopea, what I'd describe as a free version of photoshop, and exploring what colors I feel give off a comfortable "origami yay" feeling. This could make a decent feeling comparable to the season of spring, and hopefully these colors are able to express a similar interaction to the creative color trio itself. -->
<!-- #4d0018 text color #1 -->
<!-- #09004d text color #2 -->
<!-- black text color #3 -->

<!-- #4ab9ea cyan -->
<!-- #f9ed76 super soft light yellow with life -->
<!-- #f976bd pink? -->

<!-- class uses . and id uses # -->
<!-- Merriweather and Amatic SC fonts-->

<!-- Thinking of saving the dragon guide for a future page addition, not for this assignment. -->
<!-- There will be directions given alongside imagery to follow along with. These directions will show the viewer how to make something of their own as they follow along. -->

  --primary-color: #A2D2FF   ;
