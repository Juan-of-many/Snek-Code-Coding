<!-- I overhauled my color palette by going into photopea, what I'd describe as a free version of photoshop, and exploring what colors I feel give off a comfortable "origami yay" feeling. This could make a decent feeling comparable to the season of spring, and hopefully these colors are able to express a similar interaction to the creative color trio itself. -->

                <div class="davinci_description">Some theorize that the ancient art of paper folding, origami, originated somewhere in china or japan, alongside the invention of paper. Early forms of Egyptian papyrus predate even the earliest forms of cloth-based paper. The history of origami is murky, filled with holes and cryptic retelling of myth. If you wish to know the truth on when exactly origami began, you will need to find or build a paper time machine modeled after the ancient blueprint. Unfortunately for us, it has been 500 years since Leonardo Da Vinci's life, and he accidentally dropped the second half of his journal with the blueprint on his trip through ancient Alexandria.</div>

                <h2>How It All Started</h2>
                <p>Be it through crumpling up an old piece of homework, doggy-ear-ing a page in a book, crafting paper planes, chances are that you have experience with some form of paper-folding.
                    I'm here to help make origami less of a daunting idea.
                    I was officially introduced to the concept of origami by a friend just a decade ago.
                    He encouraged me to follow online guides to create things like ninja stars and animals of all kinds. 
                    I wanted to get the chance to create cool things like what he was playing with.
                    Since then, I have continued making origami creations on and off as the years have passed.</p>

                <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
                <p>With the passage of time, origami has been a constant and comfortable form of self-expression for me.
                    I am often inspired by other people's works of art and creations.
                    Seeing their art or hearing their music or just talking with a passionate friend motivates me to create something special to go with the memory.</p>
                    <p>If more people chose to create and add their beauty to the world, I believe that the world would become filled with wonder and beauty. I'm doing my part, sharing the beauty of origami to those around me, hoping to make some of their worlds a little prettier.</p>

                <p>Disclaimer: If you start delving into origami and continue exploring and becoming inspired for years, you may have many fond memories to hold dear and many wonderful friends to thank. Be warned: your collection may also get out of hand.</p>
