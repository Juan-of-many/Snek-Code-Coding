<!-- I overhauled my color palette by going into photopea, what I'd describe as a free version of photoshop, and exploring what colors I feel give off a comfortable "origami yay" feeling. This could make a decent feeling comparable to the season of spring, and hopefully these colors are able to express a similar interaction to the creative color trio itself. -->

            <!-- My Inspiration -->
            <!-- The above explains 1) A friend of mine introduced me to the concept of origami over a decade ago.
            2) I have continued making origami creations on and off during the time from then until now. 
            3) It gives my hands something to do if/when my mind is racing. Origami is a healthy and comfortable form of self-expression through physical art.
            4) An additional hidden message that I share with many pieces of origami that I make is that I took something that would otherwise have been discarded and turned it into a beautiful piece of art for someone else to enjoy. I turn one man's trash into another man's treasure. If it is discarded again, that is okay. Even if it gave comfort and joy for a small moment, it was worth any amount of time it took for me to fold.
            5) Why I keep folding is because I am inspired by other people's works of art and creation and working with my hands is one thing I am adept at. If more people chose to create and add their beauty to the world, I believe that the world would grow in beauty. I have taken this train of thought and acted upon it, taking time when I can to make something that might put a smile on someone else's face, sharing joy with those around me.
            6) Special thanks to Jared for introducing me to origami, the internet

            <!-- Here's something that took me forever to learn: 
                 If you want to enjoy life more, you need to explore more of life.  Encourage yourself to explore hobbies that don't make you money or aren't applicable to your job. Doing so will lead you to discover more aspects of life that you enjoy outside of work. Your options will expand and you will gain a valuable space away from work.

                 Your creativity will lead you to new experiences. 
                 You can find numerous videos online teaching you how to fold a fortune-teller. 
                 Show how to make a mutated fortune-teller. 
                I now invite you to do the same.-->

<!-- Extra notes:
Life can sometimes feel full of craziness and plenty of chaos.
It can be tough, feeling that you may be broken or lost as life passes you by.
I've faced similar thoughts myself, and I'm sorry to say that there isn't some magical solution to immediately make everything perfect.
Instead, I have found comfort in improving my self-reflection and self-expression.
When the world starts to feel overwhelming or too out of control, find some small thing you can control, and spend time with it.

Artistic hobbies like Origami can be a beautiful place to turn when you want to spend time in a quieter place,
