            <!-- The above explains 1) Jared is a friend of mine who introduced me to the concept of origami over a decade ago.
            2) I have continued making origami creations on and off during the time from then until now. 
            3) It gives my hands something to do if/when my mind is racing. Origami is a healthy and comfortable form of self-expression through physical art.
            4) An additional hidden message that I share with many pieces of origami that I make is that I took something that would otherwise have been discarded and turned it into a beautiful piece of art for someone else to enjoy. I turn one man's trash into another man's treasure. If it is discarded again, that is okay. Even if it gave comfort and joy for a small moment, it was worth any amount of time it took for me to fold.
            5) Why I keep folding is because I am inspired by other people's works of art and creation and working with my hands is one thing I am adept at. If more people chose to create and add their beauty to the world, I believe that the world would grow in beauty. I have taken this train of thought and acted upon it, taking time when I can to make something that might put a smile on someone else's face, sharing joy with those around me.
            6) Special thanks to Jared for introducing me to origami, the internet
