      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The Explore Origami website will introduce origami to those seeking a new hobby. The website will inspire and teach individuals of all ages that they can enjoy relaxing hobbies. It will guide viewers through how to fold one design and will share my story of why I appreciate origami.</p> 


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Explore Origami is intended for people all ages to visit, feel inspired, and to learn more about origami as an option for a creative hobby. I hope this website will introduce viewers to the idea that they should be proud of their hobbies, so they may feel guilt-free in enjoying personal time. The ideal audience member is someone who is struggling with expressing themselves, or finding it hard to have fun because they feel time spent not doing work is time wasted. I hope to shift that way of thinking to a more positive and peaceful way of thinking.</p>

        Some theorize that the ancient art of paper folding, origami, originated somewhere in china or japan, alongside the invention of paper. Early forms of Egyptian papyrus predate even the earliest forms of cloth-based paper. 
        The history of origami is murky, filled with holes and cryptic retelling of myth.
        If you wish to know the truth on when exactly origami began, you will need to find or build a paper time machine modeled after the ancient blueprint. 
        Unfortunately for you, it has been 500 years since Leonardo Da Vinci's life, and he accidentally dropped the second half of his journal with the blueprint on his trip through ancient Alexandria.

        How It All Started
        <br>
        Be it through crumpling up an old piece of homework, doggy-ear-ing a page in a book, crafting paper planes, chances are that you have experience with some form of paper-folding.
        I'm here to help make origami less of a daunting idea.
        I was officially introduced to the concept of origami by a friend just one decade ago.
        He encouraged me to follow online guides to create things like ninja stars and animals of all kinds. 
        I wanted to get the chance to create cool things like what he was playing with.
        Since then, I have continued making origami creations on and off as the years have passed.

        <br>
        <br> 
        My Inspiration
        <br>
        With the passage of time, origami has been a constant and comfortable form of self-expression for me.
        Origami gives my hands something to do while my mind can focus on another task.

        <br> <br>

        An additional hidden message that I share with many pieces of origami that I make is that I took something that would otherwise have been discarded and turned it into a beautiful piece of art for someone else to enjoy. 
        I turn one man's trash into another man's treasure. 
        If it is discarded again, that is okay. Even if it gave comfort and joy for a small moment, it was worth any amount of time it took for me to fold.

      <h3>Fortune-Teller Guide</h3>
      <p>
        
        Begin by finding a piece of paper. Any paper works, however I would suggest avoiding cardstock and anything smaller than a post-it note. 
        <br>
        If your paper is a standard 8x11" sheet or any non-square rectangle, we will want to turn it into a square by removing the excess paper to make it look like this:
        image
        <br>
        Fold your square diagonally in half, creasing your paper along that diagonal by pressing it between your fingertips or pressing it against the table.
        image
        <br>
        Unfold your square and fold it diagonally in half as shown below
        image
        <br>
        Unfold your square once again and fold one corner in so that it is nearly touching the center of your square.
        image
        <br>
        Repeat so all four corners are folded in.
        image
        <br>
        Then, flip your new, small square over.
        image
        <br>
        Fold one corner in towards the middle, so that it is nearly touching the center.
        image
        <br>
        Repeat for each corner.
        image
        <br>
        Take your now smaller square and fold it in half vertically.
        image
        <br>
        Unfold it, and fold it in half horizonatally.
        image
        <br>
        Flip it over, and now you should see the four spaces where you can fit your fingers to maneuver and control your completed fortune-teller.

      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      <p>
        
        What 
        Why I keep folding is because I am inspired by other people's works of art and creation and working with my hands is one thing I am adept at. 
        If more people chose to create and add their beauty to the world, I believe that the world would grow in beauty. 
        I have taken this train of thought and acted upon it, taking time when I can to make something that might put a smile on someone else's face, sharing joy with those around me.
        

        In the end, it feels really great to spend time and end up with something tangible to show for my efforts.
        I hope you've enjoyed following along and will check back in later as I add new guides and update old ones.
