      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The Explore Origami website will introduce origami to those seeking a new hobby. The website will inspire and teach individuals of all ages that they can enjoy relaxing hobbies. It will guide viewers through how to fold one design and will share my story of why I appreciate origami.</p> 


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Explore Origami is intended for people all ages to visit, feel inspired, and to learn more about origami as an option for a creative hobby. I hope this website will introduce viewers to the idea that they should be proud of their hobbies, so they may feel guilt-free in enjoying personal time. The ideal audience member is someone who is struggling with expressing themselves, or finding it hard to have fun because they feel time spent not doing work is time wasted. I hope to shift that way of thinking to a more positive and peaceful way of thinking.</p>

      <p>
        Some theorize that the ancient art of paper folding, origami, originated somewhere in china or japan, alongside the invention of paper. Early forms of Egyptian papyrus predate even the earliest forms of cloth-based paper. 
        The history of origami is murky, filled with holes and cryptic retelling of myth.
        If you wish to know the truth on when exactly origami began, you will need to find or build a paper time machine modeled after the ancient blueprint. 
        Unfortunately for you, it has been 500 years since Leonardo Da Vinci's life, and he accidentally dropped the second half of his journal with the blueprint on his trip through ancient Alexandria.

        How It All Started
        <br>
        Be it through crumpling up an old piece of homework, doggy-ear-ing a page in a book, crafting paper planes, chances are that you have experience with some form of paper-folding.
        I'm here to help make origami less of a daunting idea.
        I was officially introduced to the concept of origami by a friend just a decade ago.
        He encouraged me to follow online guides to create things like ninja stars and animals of all kinds. 
        I wanted to get the chance to create cool things like what he was playing with.
        Since then, I have continued making origami creations on and off as the years have passed.

        <br>
        <br> 
        My Inspiration
        <br>
        With the passage of time, origami has been a constant and comfortable form of self-expression for me.
        I am often inspired by other people's works of art and creations.
        Seeing their art or hearing their music or just talking with a passionate friend motivates me to create something special to go with the memory.

    
        <br> <br> <!-- double line break -->

        image - dragon_hoard + disclaimer to jokingly call out friends or thank them for the lovely memories, or to joke that it has gone out of hand.
        If more people chose to create and add their beauty to the world, I believe that the world would become filled with wonder and beauty. 
        I'm doing my part, sharing the beauty of origami to those around me, hoping to make some of their worlds a little prettier.

        <!-- Extra notes:
        Here's something that took me forever to learn: 
        If you want to enjoy life more, you need to explore more of life.  Encourage yourself to explore hobbies that don't make you money or aren't applicable to your job. Doing so will lead you to discover more aspects of life that you enjoy outside of work. Your options will expand and you will gain a valuable space away from work.

        Life can sometimes feel full of craziness and plenty of chaos.
        It can be tough, feeling that you may be broken or lost as life passes you by.
        I've faced similar thoughts myself, and I'm sorry to say that there isn't some magical solution to immediately make everything perfect.
        Instead, I have found comfort in improving my self-reflection and self-expression.
        When the world starts to feel overwhelming or too out of control, find some small thing you can control, and spend time with it.

        Artistic hobbies like Origami can be a beautiful place to turn when you want to spend time in a quieter place. -->

      <h3>Fortune-Teller Guide</h3>
      <p>
        
        This page is dedicated to directing the audience to fold their own fortune-teller.
        Begin by finding a piece of paper. Any paper works, however I would suggest avoiding cardstock and anything smaller than a post-it note. 
        <br>
        If your paper is a standard 8x11" sheet or any non-square rectangle, we will want to turn it into a square by removing the excess paper to make it look like this:
        image
        <br>
        Fold your square diagonally in half, creasing your paper along that diagonal by pressing it between your fingertips or pressing it against the table.
        image
        <br>
        Unfold your square and fold it diagonally in half as shown below
        image
        <br>
        Unfold your square once again and fold one corner in so that it is nearly touching the center of your square.
        image
        <br>
        Repeat so all four corners are folded in.
        image
        <br>
        Then, flip your new, small square over.
        image
        <br>
        Fold one corner in towards the middle, so that it is nearly touching the center.
        image
        <br>
        Repeat for each corner.
        image
        <br>
        Take your now smaller square and fold it in half vertically.
        image
        <br>
        Unfold it, and fold it in half horizonatally.
        image
        <br>
        Flip it over, and now you should see the four spaces where you can fit your fingers to maneuver and control your completed fortune-teller.

        What keeps me going? (potentially in list format)
        <br>
        I like working with my hands.
        I enjoy the creative process within this hobby.
        I love the many available options paper-folding provides.
        There are many learning opportunities.
        Generally, anyone can pick up a piece of paper and make something.
        It is a niche hobby.
        Origami can take as much or as little time as you want it to.
        It is something that makes people smile.
        Origami gives my hands something to do while my mind can focus on other tasks.
        <br>
        <br>

        Here is where the steps to change the origami fortune teller will be laid out.
        <!-- designate all steps of how to mutate under a title that references one of the above list members. -->
        <br> <br>
        To all the lovely people who have supported me over the years:
        <br>
        We dare to share, a love so real, your comfort, I feel.
        Your care so fair, I hold you dear, your thoughts, I hear.
        So wonderful, so true, your words, I view.
        Your encouragement ever warms my heart.
        May you find wonder and success every day.
        <br>
        <br>
        An additional hidden message that I share with many pieces of origami that I make is that I took something that would otherwise have been discarded and turned it into a beautiful piece of art for someone else to enjoy. 
        I turn one man's trash into another man's treasure. 
        If it is discarded again, that is okay. Even if it gave comfort and joy for only a small moment, it was worth the time it took to fold.
        
        <br>
        In the end, it feels really great to spend time and end up with something tangible to show for my efforts.
        I hope you've enjoyed following along and will check back in later as I add new guides and update old ones.

        The wireframe.cc website I was using began having some trouble in the middle of making the home page. It would not allow me to select the content of any box other than one specific line of text you may notice being highlighted by an off-set blue box, and I was not given the ability to unselect that item. That blue box will not be there, there will be slightly more whitespace on my actual document, and the box in the way of "My Inspiration" will not be a part of my website. You're awesome.
