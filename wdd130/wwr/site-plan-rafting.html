    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This site will be constructed to increase digital traffic and revenues for the white-water rafting business. The additional online pressence will be able to reach more prospective customers. Hopefully, this will also bolster the local economy by bringing in more tourism.  We will offer options for calmer water-based activities for those who want to feel more secure in the water and a speedy thrill for those looking for excitement!</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This company is primarily focused on catering to the rafting needs of tourists traveling from out of town. The target demographic is families with older teenagers and individuals looking to enjoy a holiday or vacation away from home. Some folks come for the rush. Some folks come for the water. All folks come to have fun. This rafting experience adds a physical splash to entertainment. We are here to challenge thrillseekers to push their enjoyment to a whole new level. For the less experienced, we want to give them positive experiences with water-based activities so that they can build trust with water and maybe come back in the future to enjoy our more intense rafting experiences. All skill levels are welcome at Float Your Boat Rafting! Locals will be given discount rates to incentivize choosing our rafting experiences and thank them for being a part of our community. I imagine our audience will access this site primarily from a mobile device while seeking out places to see on tour, with desktop and laptop users being very valued for those who plan further ahead for the experience.</p>
