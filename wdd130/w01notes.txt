How to get a webpage onto the internet?
type out code somewhere, then type ctrl + o and the page will be shown on the browser offline.
vs code live server extension uses local host address

Store files in a place where they can be retrieved by anyone = called hosting.
many people choose to purchase website hosting services so they can rely on someone with better internet service to host their website.
domain name has to be unique from every other website out there - registered with Domain Name System (DNS) that will keep track of where the files are stored.

many sites are willing to host your web files for a fee (usually monthly subscription)
sometimes they will also offer to help you register your domain name.

File Transfer Protocol = FTP = connecting to your hosting and sending them your files to publicly host and alter your website. (local to remote global)

Glitch or Github ~~~ free ~~~ you will not have your own domain name, it will have .glitch.me or .github.io at the end. People can still find it online though.
