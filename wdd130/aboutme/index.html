    <h2>John Boger</h2>
    <p>Howdy howdy everybody!</p>
    <p>I am one of many by the name of John. Each John must collectively work to stand out among the masses. What makes me stand out? Good question. I'm glad you asked and didn't just read something online from someone talking to themself. What makes me stand out is my sense of humor, love for various artforms, and my care for the people around me. I am an avid storyteller and roleplayer and love spending time with friends in any way I can.</p>
    <p>I like to take the time to add something extra into my work so that those who are paying attention can either find deeper meaning in it to relate to their own lives, or a light-hearted play on words to lift their spirits. I am currently attending BYU-Idaho as a Computer Information Technology major. I am taking this Web Fundamentals course because it is one of the required courses for my major and because I am interested in learning more of how people and computers communicate.</p>
    <p>It is my pleasure to share this semester with you all! I wish you all luck as we begin this semester! Thank you for taking the time and energy to read what I have to share!</p>
